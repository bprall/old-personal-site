# personal-website
The code for my [personal website](https://bprall.github.io) which dynamically loads via javascript modules, loads projects based on url, and can actively filter news and projects on the main page. The site can be easily updated via the data.json file in order to change any details or add new news and projects. It was also designed using grid in order to reformat seamlessly depending on the width of the screen, allowing for easy navigation on any device.

All code was written by Blake Prall
