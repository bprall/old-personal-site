# personal-website
The code for my [personal website](prallb.glitch.me).
It is designed to be a "single-page" website in which instead of navigating users to other html files, the new pages are instead dynamically generated via javascript.
The site also uses CSS flex and grid to dynamically reformat based on current screen dimensions.
